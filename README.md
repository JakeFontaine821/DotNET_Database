# DotNET_Database
 
This project is from a couple years ago. 
From when I was learning .NET and SQL, it's a simple login system where you can add, delete, update and get all entries from a database and display on a .NET application.

Disclaimer: Without going back through the code, I can confidently say there are going to be errors and bad practice mistakes made.
